External VS Internal Tables:

Lets take the analogy of cloud computing vs traditional computing.

In traditional days, everything was set up in house. Servers, DBs, Web servers etc. so you are only responsible for
these resources. You manage them and if your contract expire with client, these resources are of no use and 
become null and void, in other terms resources will be removed along with contract expiration.

In Cloud computing world everything is shared. You are not owning anything so no set up at your location,
only you have the links to reach. You can use resources however you want. if you are not using it, 
resources will not get null and void as resources are shared. Same resources can and must be used by someone else.
Cloud allows same resource usage by many.

Traditional computing is INTERNAL Tables and Cloud Computing is EXTERNAL tables.

INTERNAL TABLES:

1. Table created is also called MANAGED table.
2. In case MANAGED tables are dropped, data will be also trashed out from HDFS.
3. DO Not use INTERNAL table schema on top of SHARED data.
4. Not recommended for PRODUCTION.
5. By default table creation is INTERNAL Table.


EXTERNAL TABLES:

1. These are equivalent to cloud in our analogy, Do everything but hold nothing.
2. If you select data in these EXTERNAL tables you will get results.
3. If you DELETE some rows from tables and do SELECT, you won't see the deleted data.
4. However If you go to HDFS location from where data is loaded and search for the deleted row, 
you will find them in file as EXTERNAL tables are virtual schema on top of file data.
5. Its just an schema and if you make changes in data at table level, you can see the changes in table
but at file level no changes are propagated i.e. METASTORE is taking care of table changes,
REAL file is not touched at all.
5. If REAL file is not touched at all, it is TRUE virtualisation and many clients can use it for analysis purpose.
6. As WRITE ONCE and READ many times is MANTRA of HADOOP, so EXTERNAL Tables are the right tables to create.


Practice:

Before start creating Tables, lets ponder on some points:

1. Table can be created in two ways:

     A. Create table schema and load data in it, in other words move data from its location to                warehouse directory.

          Hive provides LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INPATH command for this purpose.
   
     B. Create table schema on top of exiting data, so effectively you are moving table creation logic to   the place where data resides, you are not moving the data.

        LOCATION command should be used for this during table creation.

2. Table creation from LOCAL cause file copy from LOCAL to HDFS, however table creation using HDFS file cause movement of data within HDFS only i.e. mv command is invoked.

3. DATA Set up :

        Download data from this location for this exp: Download.zip
     
        Remove the header line from data ( first line of the file ) keep the file somewhere in your local, and put a copy of the same in HDFS using put command as well.
   
        in my system, I have file LOCALLY at ''/home/sushil/bigadata/hivedata/geolocation.csv' and in HDFS at /hive/data/


INTERNAL tables:

CREATE TABLE geolocation 
( truckid String, driverid String ,event String ,latitude double,
longitude double,city String ,state String ,velocity int,event_ind int ,idling_ind int )
COMMENTS 'An example for internal table creation' 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


2. Load data from the file:


LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/sushil/bigadata/hivedata/geolocation.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE geolocation;


3. View data :

SELECT * FROM geolocation limit 100;

4. Check where file is in HDFS:

go to /user/hive/warehouse/movielens.db/geolocation/ location.

here movielens is my database in hive.

you should see a file name geolocation.csv is created.

so literally hadoop fs put command is invoked in case of in LOAD from local.


EXTERNAL table:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE geolocation_ext 
( truckid String, driverid String ,event String ,latitude double,
longitude double,city String ,state String ,velocity int,event_ind int ,idling_ind int ) 
COMMENTS 'An example for external table creation'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/hive/data/geolocation.csv'

2. Load data from the file:

DATA is already loaded as we have provided LOCATION during data table creation, so instead of data movement, SCHEMA is moved, i.e. schema is created on TOP of data. 

3. View data :

SELECT * FROM geolocation_ext limit 100;

4. Check where file is in HDFS:

go to /user/hive/warehouse/movielens.db/ location.

here movielens is my database in hive.

you should not see any folder named geolocation_ext created as file is not moved.

File would be available at its original location: /hive/data/geolocation.csv'

We have one more kind of TABLE named TEMPORARY table, request you to practice it as well.
