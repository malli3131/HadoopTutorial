1. Oozie is a Server based Workflow Engine which runs workflow of Jobs (DAG) with actions that run Hadoop MapReduce, Pig,
   Hive,Spark Jobs, etc...

2  Oozie is Java Web application and it runs in any Servlet container like Tomcat, Jetty, etc...

3. Oozie workflow is a collection of actions (Exec, Java, Pig, Spark etc...) arranged in a control dependency DAG.

4. In Oozie workflow actions are dependent. i.e., second action cannot run until the first action has completed

5. Oozie workflows definitions are written in hPDL (a XML Process Definition Language)

6. Oozie workflow actions start jobs in remote systems (i.e. Hadoop, Pig). Upon action completion, the remote systems 
   callback Oozie to notify the action completion, at this point Oozie proceeds to the next action in the workflow.

7  Oozie workflow contains two types of nodes:
      . Action Nodes
      . Control Nodes
